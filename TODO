[i] avoid wikipedia 429 throttling
  [x] look up GCP free tier limits
    - CPU - First 180,000 vCPU-seconds free per month
    - RAM - First 360,000 GiB-seconds free per month
    - Requests - 2 million requests free per month
    [x] calculate per run limits
      - Assume up to three tries per day, up to 31 days per month
      180,000 / (3 * 31) ~= 1935 sec ~= 30 minutes
      360,000 / (3 * 31) / 1936 ~= 2 GiB
      2,000,000 / (3 * 31) ~= 20,000 requests
  [x] calculate backoff and retry
    - Six retries (not counting the first try)
    - initial delay of 11/64 minutes ~= 10 sec
    - double each time
    - total delay sum((11/64) * 2**i for i in range(6)) ~= 11
    - final delay = 5.5 minutes
  [i] introduce concept of unrecoverable error
    [ ] push the looping from main into the story module
      [ ] return found story insted of breaking
      [ ] return None after loop
      [ ] main returns 200 on no stories (None)
    [ ] define unrecoverable error
    [ ] re-raise unrecoverable error (in story loop)
    [ ] wrap 429 from client in unrecoverable error
  [ ] add backoff and retry in client
    https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#transport-adapters
    https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#example-automatic-retries
    [ ] 429 is retried with backoff in the client, up to limit
[ ] set up retries in queue
  - one hour backoff
  - three attempts total
[ ] skip stories with fewer than 400-ish characters
  - up to three tries todal
[ ] consider section title when ordering articles within story
[ ] iTunes
[ ] upgrade libraries (Pydantic?)
[ ] Audible
[ ] better error handling
